The primary goal of development is to make the feature work. During this 
time it is difficult to maintain a top-down overview.
The days of weeks and hours of engineering are over. Nowadays, you 
have to develop on working features in a relative short time and also keep that code maintainable 
in order to be able to remain constantly agile.

>With triangulating over the specification, we are able to implement the feature, make our part of the quality assurance **and** 
we continuously improve the design with refactoring in small steps.

Okay, refactoring allows us to significantly tune our design during our development work. But what exactly should we refactor now?

Let's take a look at the Refactor kickstarter series with the [Code Smell of the years](https://redseacomputing.github.io/2021/Refactoring1-1-magic-number).
