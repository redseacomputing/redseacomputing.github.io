You have seen that TDD can bring you a decisive advantage:
Refactoring not only minimize the number lines of code. 
The even greater and decisive benefit is, that you are able to shape and knead your software solution as you need it.

In order to develop production code, you reference from tests.

Often production code is developed and the "annoying" tests are added quickly afterwards.
