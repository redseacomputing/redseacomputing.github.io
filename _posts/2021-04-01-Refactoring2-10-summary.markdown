![Summary](../images/Refactoring/Refactor-summary.png)

We have seen that TDD can bring us a decisive advantage:
Refactoring not only enables us to minimize the number of lines of code. 
The even greater and decisive benefit is, that we can shape and knead our software solution as we need it. That keeps us agile.

In order to develop production code, we reference from tests.

It is not uncommon for us to find untested code. 
Often production code is developed and then the "annoying" tests are quickly added at the end.

So it is that we refer from production code to a test suite. And this is exactly the topic of the next blog: [Working on legacy code](https://redseacomputing.github.io/2021/Legacy-Code-introduction).
