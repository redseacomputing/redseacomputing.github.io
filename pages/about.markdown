redseacomputing is a pseudonym for me as a enthusiast of programming (especially with Java). 
The idea behind the pseudonym came during a holiday in egypt at the red sea.
Since there, I have decided to live my passion instead of doing the same stuff
every one has to do during his/her lifetime.

During my education at an evening school, my colleagues were doing things "fast", 
instead of doing it correct.
From there on, i was an enemy of the "copy & paste"-programming style.

Instead of flying the mouse over production code for guessing the next steps,
I have decided to develop my solutions test driven.

After knowing the basics of that, I began to refactor my code.
Therefore, in my oppinion solid development is based on test driven 
development and Clean Code. 

Nowadays I introduce myself into refactoring tactics to make 
code maintanable, clear and testable.

Because code is technology.
