## [Java](https://www.java.com/)

Class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have 
as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application 
developers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code 
can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java 
virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, 
Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

## [Spring](https://spring.io)


An application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. 
The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.

to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.


## [JUnit](https://junit.org/)

## [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level 
virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, 
libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through 
well-defined channels.All containers are run by a single 
operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.
